# Heart_attack_predictor

➔ Developed a robust heart attack predictor using machine learning techniques and a dataset comprising various clinical attributes such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and heart rate.

➔  Utilized algorithms like Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Random Forests for predictive modeling, along with exploration of feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.

➔  Employed comprehensive evaluation metrics including accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity to assess model effectiveness and provided insights into model performance.

➔  Conducted data visualization to understand relationships between features and heart attack occurrences, aiding in model interpretation and validation.

➔  Utilized advanced techniques like hyperparameter tuning and dimensionality reduction to optimize model performance and improve predictive accuracy.

➔  Justified the Decision Tree model's higher accuracy due to its superior ability to capture non-linear relationships and interactions among features compared to other models.

➔  Ultimately the Decision Tree model achieved higher accuracy possibly due to its ability to capture non-linear relationships and interactions among features more effectively than other models.
